					<h2>Introducing Zenlike</h2>
					<p>Zenlike is a brand new website that offers you an innovative way to plan and review your daily life. It is a life management app for busy people that want to structure their fitness, diet and relaxation.</p>
					<p>Our main aim is to provide an easy-to-use service that is free and lightweight. Most of all, we think it will become an essential addition to your suite of apps and web services.</p>
					<p>We all know the importance these days of maintaining a Zen-like calm. How can we make everybody have a Zen-like calm, yet also be well prepared for the stresses and strains of modern Western society? Well, the answer lies in giving power to the user to manage how they can apply centuries-old philosophies of mindfulness to their own lives. Primarily, it is envisioned that this balance would be achieved by planning and monitoring meditations, healthy diet and a course of bespoke physical exercise that fits in with their lives.</p>
					<p>The overall vision of Zenlike is that of being a one-stop shop for doing all of these things and potentially more.</p>
